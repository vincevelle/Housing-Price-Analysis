# Housing-Price-Analysis

This is a personal project where I explore the use of three different predictive models (linear regression, random forest, and gradient boost) on the California Housing Price Dataset (see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset for more details). 

The project also includes a user-interface where users can see the data plotted geographically over a map of California, alongside some charts comparing the three models and their performance (evaluated using R^2 and RMSE scores). 

This project is a work in progress, and I will soon flesh out the visualizations and add more datasets to provide better insights. Please note that the program is running three models, so it may take a while to fully run.
